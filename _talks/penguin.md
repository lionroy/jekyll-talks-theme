## What the SDG is all about?

[UNDP | Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html)

 - 193 countries signed 
 - Specific 17 *Goals*, each w/ *Targets* and ~340 *Indicators*
 - Each goal has set of specific parameters (aka. KPI)
 - 2-step _'Deadlines:'_ 2020, 2030


## Let's Set the course for the next decade(s)

 - Adopting SDG means: *Duty of SDG Reporting (country)*
 - Corporates and Countries have to work together
 - Parameters are presets
 - Programs develop specific best-practices


## SDG features over time:

- Manages state(s)
- Handles country input
- Country handles NGO input
- Adds KPI to exising programs
- Acquire and run programs


## Social-Programs meets opensource community

you can *share* social programs the same way!
_using markdown_ makes publishing easy

*Online Repo rules* so you never make another ppt.

``` js
//some pseudo-code
our.social.content('#mySocialProgram', [
  country()
  goals(),
  keys(),
  actors(),
  media('THIS IS IMPORTANT!'),
  instance('Penguin-August-2018'),
  etc...
]);
```


## Forking Social-Programs made easy

Every instance you create 
now lives in the land of code   
as a separate module of the original one

``` js
//pseudo-code
var index  = require('SDG-index'),
    classes  = require('SDG-classes'),
    keys     = require('SDG-keys'),
    oss      = require('SDG-repositories'),
    outlets  = require('SDG-bullets'),
    etc...
```

plus, you can share *_any_* content on nifty opensource platforms

## Big-Data | "Show me the data"

Many govs adopt an Open-Data Policy (US, IL, EU..)  
And make it accessible as RESTful/API
[18F Blog | Autoring APIs](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/)

``` js
//pseudo-code
social.module.exports = function(myData, yourData) {
  return function(deck) {
    deck.next();
    deck.prev();
    // etc...
  };
};
```


## An API to track KPI's

![SDG Index](https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/#/)
- Global datasets by country from World Bank 
- Driven by Open-data. Powered by research institute
- Actors are encouraged to create source-code and APIs
* [Bonus: 18f Authoring API](https://18f.gsa.gov/)


## 2018 | The Challenge

UP20 Aims at *Bridging the Digital Divide*
we encourage...
   - Definitions, Policy, Content
   - Professional community for social innovation
   - open-source SHARING content via repositories
=> Marketplace for Social Innovation (!)


## 2020 | Authoring Experience Complete

UP20 is based on the belief together we can
  - Make better use of opensource methods, ethics
  - Reach wide audiences and resourceful social innovators
  - Teach people how to overcome the opensource learning curve
  - And how to become successful activators and facilitators
  > For the best authoring experience and data handeling

## Challenges | Perfect for collaborating yet..

> remember - no perfect solution
  - new strategy
  - need contributors
  - resourcefulness

## In Conclusion | Repos provide a safe space for your crazy experiments

*Best-Practices:* 
 - sharing ideas
 - working together
 - community owning the development pipeline
 - open-data ^ open-source => open sesame
 - versions, verifications, validations
 - collaborators become communities
 - managing reports and graphing
 - simplified access 
 - across the globe


## Great for maintenance mode

- Communication-Bugs are minimised
- Mistaken reports are minimised
- Your NGO reports tend to go to the right place
- You get to keep your sanity
